# Team Task Management System

A full-stack **Role-Based Task Management System** built with **NestJS (Backend)** and **Next.js (Frontend)**.
The application allows administrators to manage users, assign tasks, set priorities, verify completion, and monitor analytics through an admin dashboard.
Users can view assigned tasks, track priorities, and mark tasks as completed.

This project demonstrates **JWT authentication, role-based access control, task management, and dashboard analytics** in a modern full-stack architecture.
